        <h2>Description</h2>
        My cabbage roll casserole has all the ingredients of stuffed cabbage rolls but is a lot easier to make! This basic recipe will appeal to everyone but if you prefer more flavor, consider adding crushed garlic, paprika, thyme, or cayenne pepper.


        <h2>Ingredient</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds ground beef</li>
            <li>3 Â½ pounds chopped cabbage</li>
            <li>1 (29 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
            <li>1 cup chopped onion</li>
            <li>1 cup uncooked white rice</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 (14 ounce) cans beef broth</li>    
            


        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

            </li>
            <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease.</li>
            <li>Combine cabbage, tomato sauce, onion, rice, and salt in a large mixing bowl. Stir in cooked ground beef. Pour mixture into a 9x13-inch baking dish, then pour beef broth over top.</li>
            <li>Cover and bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour. Stir, re-cover, and bake until cabbage is tender and rice is done, 20 to 30 minutes more.</li>
            
        </ol>
